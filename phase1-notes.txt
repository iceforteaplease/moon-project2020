What do I need to implement phase 1 :

  standard format spreadsheet for south 1st and westlake?
    add day numbers, add vendor names?
    standardized spreadsheet names?
    confirm spreadsheet format with Dustin?

  research permissions for certain rows?

  share spreadsheet so program can run?

  test that program can pull data from both spreadsheets?

  create text file/google doc with all food vendors and products?

  get with Sarah to go over details?

  get staff to put zeros in instead of leaving blank?

  adjust program to work with new spreadsheet format?

  test program with new spreadsheet format?


Program things :

  clear out needs to work for variable number of cells?

  think about array mapping instead of many variables?

  combine appropriate files to run together in most efficient way?

  created files have month/year in name? could always manually change after, but would be cool
